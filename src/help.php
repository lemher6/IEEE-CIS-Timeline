      <h3>Guideline to Contribute to the CIS History Timeline</h3>

        <b>This document provides a guideline on best practices while contributing to the CIS History Timeline (CIS-HT).</b>
        <br><br>
        The purpose of the CIS-HT is to provide a portal where CIS students, researchers, and the public in general can find important past (and future, i.e. soon-to-be-past) 
        events in the History of the CIS and CI in general.  Here, users will be able to upload pictures of attendees and participants in such CIS events; original documents,
         manuscripts, and reports that reflect important milestones in our history and the history of the development of CI and AI in general; videos with interviews of 
         prominent researchers; and so on.  The CIS-HT follows a wikipedia-like model where anyone can contribute. However, ours is a moderated model, meaning: contributions 
         will be submitted and initially hidden from other users. All submissions will then be scrutinized by the CIS History Committee members who will approve or reject 
         the contribution according to the following criteria:
        <br><br>
        <b>1.</b> Photos/Videos must be owned by the authors;
        <br>
        <b>2.</b> Permissions for use of the material must be obtained whenever applicable;
        <br>
        <b>3.</b> Materials/Events should not focus on ‘self-promotion’ or the promotion of any particular group, but of the CIS and its members in general -- e.g. 
                  pictures of attendees in a conference must not focus on one person/group of people;
        <br>          
        <b>4.</b> Documents must have a recognizable and widely accepted historical value to the CIS;
        <br>
        ...
        <br><br>
        Once approved, the contribution will be made publicly visible and the author(s) will be notified. If any contribution violates any of the guidelines, the author of the contribution will be simply informed of the guideline number that was violated. No further explanations will be provided, however one opportunity for an appeal to the decision will be accepted.
        <br><br>
        Indicate in the submission form which criterion is ‘appeable’ -- e.g. #4 would not be appeable. The form should include a justification for the submission.
        <br><br>
        For sake of documenting the reason the committee denied a contribution and avoid having to list every single reason, the form will include a reason for the denial.  
        <br><br>
        Add information on how to submit (directly on the website or by email). 
        <br><br>
        Copyright material: should be mentioned? Should it list the name of the owner? Keep archive of all submission forms, emails, etc… with copyright information.
        <br><br>
        Make website look and feel like a museum 
        <br><br>
        Prepare the form for downloading and online access

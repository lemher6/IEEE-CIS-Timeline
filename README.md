# IEEE-CIS Timeline V 1.3.3

  Timeline project for IEEE-CIS

  Using TimelineJS tool from Knight Lab IEEE-CIS events will be displayed. Additional parts of this project are:


  1) Create/Update/Detele events friendly using an entry form. TimelineJS uses a Google sheet or JSON.

  2) Manage levels of users. Types of users:  
          a) general user, who can only see the timeline;
          b) contributors who can add events that are kept in a ’sandbox’ waiting approval;
          c) history committee members, who can approve events in the sandbox making them visible to all; and
          d) admin (full control);

  3) Authentication of the login of the users. Use IEEE to authenticate the identity and level of the users above.
